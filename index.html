            <p>I was originally born in Gainesville, Florida but grew up in Cary, North Carolina. I moved from North Carolina 6 years ago with my husband and golden retriever. Kevin and I started dating in high school and got married after college. We have been together almost 12 years. He is currently a dolphin trainer at Discovery Cove. Our dog is our child. She is a golden retriever named Lilu and her special talents include taking long naps, and begging for treats. </p>
